Simple Micronaut Vue Demo

The server subproject includes a Micronaut service for managing
Person instances in a relational database.

The ui subproject includes a Vue front end which communicates
with the Micronaut service.

To run the services you will need to have JDK 8 or later
installed and configured.

Run the server:

./gradlew server:run

After the server starts run the ui:

./gradlew ui:run

After the ui starts up open a browser to send a request
to http://localhost:8080/ to access the UI.

The server is configured to use an in memory database so
the data will disappear when the process is terminated.

To build a standalone executable jar to serve up both
the ui and the REST api, execute the assembleServerAndClient task:

./gradlew assembleServerAndClient

Run the standalone jar:

java -jar server/build/libs/server-0.1-all.jar
